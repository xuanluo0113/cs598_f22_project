### Data download instruction

The training data (MIMIC-III) used in the project is publically available with retrictions at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/.

### Preprocessing code

Preprocessing code and libraries are in `data_processing` folder and can be retrieved using `data_processing.load_data` command.

### Training & Evalue code 

All baseline and target model codes, including data loader, models, and training and evaluation code are executable in each Jupyter notebook.
